# my-government-services

The my-government-services repo contains three unique application configurations: **My Health Services, My Hazard Information and, My Government Services.** 

**My Government Services** is a configuration of ArcGIS and a JavaScript application that helps residents locate a government facility and obtain information about curbside and drop-off services provided by a government agency. This application is typically used by residents in a community, but can be used by visitors to locate a library or post office near them.

**My Hazard Information** is a configuration of ArcGIS and a JavaScript application that helps residents discover hazards that exist in their community and obtain information about evacuation routes and government facilities provided by a government agency. 

**My Health Services** is a configuration of ArcGIS and a JavaScript application that helps residents locate a health facility and obtain information about services provided within their community.
