# my-government-services

My Government Services is a configuration of ArcGIS Server and a JavaScript application that helps residents locate a government facility and obtain information about curbside and drop-off services provided by a government agency. This application is typically used by residents in a community, but can be used by visitors to locate a library or post office near them.
