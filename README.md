The my-government-services repo contains three unique application configurations: **My Health Services, My Hazard Information, and My Government Services.**

**My Government Services** is a configuration of ArcGIS and a JavaScript application that helps residents locate a government facility and obtain information about curbside and drop-off services provided by a government agency. This application is typically used by residents in a community, but can be used by visitors to locate a library or post office near them. [Try the My Government Services application]

**My Hazard Information** is a configuration of ArcGIS and a JavaScript application that helps residents discover hazards that exist in their community and obtain information about evacuation routes and government facilities provided by a government agency. [Try the My Hazard Information application]

**My Health Services** is a configuration of ArcGIS and a JavaScript application that helps residents locate a health facility and obtain information about services provided within their community.[Try the My Health Services application]

## Requirements

**Start now using your own services then update the configuration files**

Once you have completed these steps, you can start using the application now by setting it up on a web server running Microsoft Internet Information Services (IIS) and using sample services supplied by Esri.
You'll need to convert to an application in IIS and use the ASP .NET 4.0. application pool.
